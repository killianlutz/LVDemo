This animation showcases the effect of parameters in the Lotka-Volterra model for species interactions, the periodicity of its physically relevant solutions and highlights the differences between the flow of a non-linear ODE and its linearization about a fixed point.

## For whom were those animations designed?
Dtudents coming from any background -especially mathematics, physics and biology- willing to grasp the concepts hidden between the mathematical formalism of differnetial equations.

## Source code
The code in the `src/` folder is written in `Julia` and builds upon the plotting library [GLMakie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/).

## Getting started 
Create a directory, open the terminal and run
```
git clone https://github.com/killianlutz/LVDemo.git
```
Then open and run the file `notebooks/introduction.ipynb` in your favorite code editor. Enjoy!

## Last words
The source code is mainly provided for reproducibility purposes and the user's convenience. Any suggestions are more than welcome.

If you enjoy those animations, I would be grateful if you could refer to this [repository](https://github.com/killianlutz/BlochBallAnim.jl) or its author [Killian Lutz](https://github.com/killianlutz).

Thank you for your time and enjoy!
